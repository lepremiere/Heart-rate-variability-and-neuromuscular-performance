# Heart-rate-variability-and-neuromuscular-performance

This repository provides the scripts used in "Heart Rate Variability and Neuromuscular Performance Responses following Resistance Exercise" (https://osf.io/43hnv/). The code is generalized for further usage. It processes force plate, dynamometry and heart rate data to calculate heart rate variability and neuromuscular performance metrics. Together with the settings in "Only_Script_You_Need_To_Care_About.m" and file labels that contain specific information, it sorts the files following study logic. Information about the correct labeling can be found in the supplements section of the project repository (https://osf.io/b9tjq/).

Prerequisites:
-   MATLAB R2020b or later
    -   Signal Processing Toolbox
    -   Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox
    -   Parrallel Computing Toolbox

Installation:
-   No installation required. Just download all files and place them in your working directory.
    
    **Note**: The main scripts will call upon "Functions" folder. This folder needs to be within the same folder as main scripts.
